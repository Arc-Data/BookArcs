### BookArcs (Tentative Name)

This is a project to learn more about using MERN stack and a playground for using React 19. The idea is to build an e-commerce website 
built around my fondness for light novels and combine features such as selling books and combine it with 
features like book progress(read) tracking and a place for giving out book impressions and discussions.
